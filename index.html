        Klepon is
        <span> a traditional Indonesian dessert </span>
        consisting of chewy, pandan-flavored glutinous rice balls filled with
        molten palm sugar and coated in grated coconut. Klepon originates from
        Java, Indonesia, and is also known as kelepon or kalalapun, also known
        outside Java as onde-onde and buah melaka. If you are already familiar
        with Japanese mochi or Chinese tangyuan, Klepon has a similar chewy and
        smooth texture because it is also made with glutinous rice flour.

      <p><strong>How to make Klepon:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          - Mix glutinous rice flour with pandan juice or flavoring and water to
          form a dough.
          <br />
          - Roll the dough into small balls and flatten to create a pocket for
          the palm sugar filling.
          <br />
          - Fill the pocket with palm sugar and seal the edges.
          <br />
          - Boil the Klepon balls in water until they float, then roll them in
          grated coconut.
          <br />
          - Serve and enjoy.
